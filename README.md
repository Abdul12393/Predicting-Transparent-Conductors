# Predicting-Transparent-Conductors
High-quality data are provided for 3,000 materials that show promise as transparent conductors. The following information has been included:

Spacegroup alabelidentifyingthesymmetryofthematerial
Total number of Al, Ga, In and O atoms in the unit cell (Ntotal)
Relative compositions of Al, Ga, and In (x, y, z)
Lattice vectors and angles: lv1, lv2, lv3 whicharelengthsgiveninunitsofangstroms(\(10−10\)meters and α, β, γ whichareanglesindegreesbetween0°and360°
A domain expert will understand the physical meaning of the above information but those with a data mining background may simply use the data as input for their models.

The task for this competition is to predict two target properties:
